**crazydice**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**crazydice** is simple browser game inspired by *Story Cubes*. You roll nine dice and make up a
story that must contain all words that were shown to you on the dice. Make sure to include a
setup and conclusion.
You can click on dice to roll them individually, click on "roll all" to roll all dice in a
given section or refresh the page to roll every die at the same time.

All credit for Story Cubes - the inspiration - goes to **Asmodée Rory**.
